This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First install dependencies: 
```bash
npm install
```
thne, run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Forking and using GH-pages
Install dependencies: 
```bash
npm install
```
Replace 'GAWebsite' with your repo name at the following lines in next.config.ts file:
basePath: isProd ? "/GAWebsite" : "",
assetPrefix: isProd ? "/GAWebsite/" : "",

Change 'UdiOEagle' to your GitHub Username and 'GAWebsite' to your repo name at the following line in package.json: 
"homepage": "https://UdiOEagle.github.io/GAWebsite",

Run
```bash
npm deploy
```

In GitHub set up pages to run from gh-pages branch, root directory.
